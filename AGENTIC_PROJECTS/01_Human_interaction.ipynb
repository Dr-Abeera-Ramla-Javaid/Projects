        "### **Objective:**\n",
        "Make your chat-agent developed in 00_chat_agent smarter by allowing it to:\n",
        "1. Get help from a human assistant when needed.\n",
        "2. Pause and ask the user for extra information if something is unclear.\n",
        "3. Personalize its answers using long-term memory.\n",
        "4. Offloading conversation to Human\n",
        "\n",
        "**Note:** This project builds on the skills learned in Project 00 and prepares you for advanced Agentic AI features like dynamic workflows and user personalization.\n",

        "### **Requirements:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Human Assistant Interrupts (Static Interrupts):**\n",
        "   - Add a feature where your chatbot can **pause** and connect to a human assistant if needed.\n",
        "   - This can be a **static interrupt**—you decide when the chatbot needs help from a human.\n",
        "   - Example: If the chatbot can’t answer a question or doesn’t have enough information, it stops and sends the question to a human for assistance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Reference Material:**\n",
        "- [Static Breakpoints](https://github.com/panaversity/learn-agentic-ai/blob/main/12_langchain_ecosystem/langgraph/course-notebooks/module-3/2_breakpoints.ipynb)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Ask the User for More Information (Dynamic Interrupts):**\n",
        "   - Make the chatbot smart enough to **pause its workflow** and ask the user for more information when it’s confused.\n",
        "   - Steps:\n",
        "     - Add a **decision step** after each user message.\n",
        "     - If the chatbot detects a question or needs more details, it pauses and asks the user to clarify.\n",
        "     - The user can:\n",
        "       - **Answer the question** to help the chatbot.\n",
        "       - **Skip the question** and let the chatbot guess the best answer.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **(Optional) Personalize Using Long-Term Memory:**\n",
        "   - Use a memory system to **save important details** about the user.\n",
        "   - Examples of what to remember:\n",
        "     - Preferences (e.g., favorite subjects, preferred clothing styles).\n",
        "     - Recurring needs (e.g., study schedules, favorite recipes).\n",
        "   - Use this memory to give **better and more personal answers** over time.\n",

        "- [Memory Template](https://github.com/langchain-ai/memory-template)\n",

        "   - User asks: *\"Can you help with tax calculations?\"*\n",

        "2. Understand how to make chatbots pause and ask for clarifications when needed.\n",
