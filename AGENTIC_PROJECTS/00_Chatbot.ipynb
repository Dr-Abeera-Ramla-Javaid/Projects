        "## Objective:\n",
        "Create a chatbot prototype that talks to users, remembers what they say during conversation, and helps them solve problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Requirements:\n",
        "**Choose Your Niche:** Pick a specific group of people or industry to help with your chatbot (e.g., students, healthcare, customer service).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Make Smart Conversations**: Make sure the chatbot answers correctly and understands what users want. Use Prompt Engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Add Useful Tools:** Give the chatbot features like helping users submit complaints, giving outfit ideas, or making study plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Short-Term Memory**: Make the chatbot remember the current conversation to give better answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Use Google Colab:** Build and test your chatbot using this platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Deliverables:\n",
        "A working chatbot prototype - Google Collab Link.\n",
        "\n",
